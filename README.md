- [x] Get a basic Results page looking okay
- [ ] Add some sort of CI Pipeline
- [ ] Automate Scryfall Card data management (tempted to just use API)
- [ ] Make it work with Mana Rocks and Mana Dorks
- [ ] Support cards that aren't in a normal layout
- [ ] Make it work with cost reduction spells 
- [ ] Properly Support cEDH
- [ ] Make it work for cards whose mana can only be used to summon a specific card type (e.g "this can only be used to cast creatures/sorceries/instants/artifacts/etc)
- [ ] Make it work for special abilities which put stuff in exile and then play it (e.g. Hideaway, Etali)
